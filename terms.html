    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <h2>Terms of Use</h2>
    <p>
      Last Updated on 9th April 2022 The mobile application (HBS) and the
      website (Hbs.in) is provided by HBS, registered and having its registered
      office at 57 ST-8, Patel Street, Alangulam, Tenkasi, Tamil Nadu - 627851.
      You hereby agree to accept the terms and conditions set forth in this
      Terms of Use. In any event or situation, if you are not agreeing with
      these terms and conditions, you are requested by HBS Services not to use
      the website or mobile app. HBS is a technology company that facilitates
      connections between buyers, participating stores, and delivery service
      providers. However, we are not accountable for the quality of goods that
      are prepared or sold by the participating stores, nor are we responsible
      for the quality of delivery services provided by the delivery service
      providers. HBS Services operates a mobile application that facilitates
      transactions between buyers and participating merchants/stores dealing in
      food, vegetables, fruits, meat and groceries. Additionally, users have the
      option to place orders for specific tasks through our platform. We offer
      delivery services or task completion within our operating areas located in
      Tamilnadu, India. The various participating stores may adopt different
      approaches to price their products for online sales in order to
      accommodate the commission paid to the delivery firm for sharing the
      delivery fee. Therefore, the online pricing of products may differ from
      in-store prices. To make it easier for customers to understand, any
      additional costs are incorporated into the store price/MRP, and the final
      payable amount is displayed on our mobile application. Our customer
      support team is available at all times to provide you with a clear
      understanding of the pricing before you place any orders on our app.
    </p>

    <h2>Cancellation and Refunds:</h2>
    <div>
      Users can cancel their order within One Minute through the app, otherwise
      users can call our customer care for the cancellation within Five Minutes.
      We reserve the right to cancel the order due to location serviceability,
      unavailability of service providers and natural disasters. If we are
      unable to reach you by phone to confirm your order, changes to your order,
      or the delivery location, we retain the right to decline processing your
      order. Merchants may cancel your order for reasons such as mistakenly
      added product listing. The mobile app users also agree on the below terms,
      You use this app service only for ordering the listed goods/ services and
      not for any unlawful purposes. The content accessible through the mobile
      app may not be copied, sold to third parties, advertised, or misused
      without consent from the service providers. You will not reach out to the
      delivery service provider for any other services/tasks other than what is
      listed in the app. It is your responsibility to ensure the accuracy of the
      delivery address you provide. We are not liable for any delays or failure
      to deliver goods or services as a result of an incorrect address provided
      by you. As Google's auto location finder provides an approximate
      geo-location, we strongly advise you to verify and amend it to ensure the
      accuracy of the address.
    </div>

    <h2>Amendments:</h2>
    <div>
      We may modify or alter the terms and conditions of this agreement at any
      time by updating this document. It is recommended that mobile app users
      refer to this document periodically for any changes or updates.

    <h2>Pictures:</h2>
    <div>
      The images displayed on the mobile app are for illustrative purposes only,

      After 48 hours, the amount you are due to receive will be refunded to your
      source account. It may take up to 3-5 business days for the refunded
      amount to appear in your bank account, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and
